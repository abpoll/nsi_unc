               Building Stock (HGBS) replacement cost data for single-family
               residences in Sarpy County, Nebraska, which are 92\% higher than
               tax assessor estimates of depreciated structural replacement
               values (DSRVs). First, HGBS costs were reduced by 92\% across
               all census blocks, resulting in mean block-level HGBS?assessor
               differences of ?31\% with a standard deviation of 144\%. Second,
               DSRVs were regressed against non-cost-related HGBS data at the
               block level via six alternative model specifications, resulting
               in R2 values of 0.59?0.68. The preferred model based on HGBS
               square footage and other census-based data resulted in predicted
               HGBS replacement costs on average being 29\% higher than DSRVs,
               although the standard deviation of the differences was 380\%.
               Finally, regressing DSRVs against tax assessor building square
               footage data resulted in a R2 value of 0.96 and an
               underprediction of actual DSRVs across blocks by only 12\%, with
               a correspondingly low standard deviation of 48\%.",

               general building stock (HGBS), widely used to estimate potential
               monetary damage to building structures from floods, earthquakes,
               or hurricanes, is quantified by comparing HGBS square footage
               and replacement-cost values to corresponding data from building
               cost inventories previously compiled for three Midwestern
               locations. The HGBS data (released in 2015 based on year 2010
               census data) underestimates all building square footage by
               between 15 and 20\% and overestimates replacement costs by
               between 31\% (without considering depreciation) and 56\%
               (including depreciation). The magnitude of HGBS inventory
               differences vary across structure types, particularly among
               different classes of commercial structures, but are markedly
               consistent across the three locations. Because the HGBS
               underestimates structure size and overestimates replacement
               costs, it severely overestimates replacement costs on a dollar
               per square foot basis, on average by between 51 and 81\%. These
               large overestimates could potentially occur with a partial or
               hybrid Level 2 HAZUS analysis, in which supplemental structural
               square footage is obtained from a non-HGBS source, such as a tax
               assessor, while using default HGBS building replacement cost
               data.",

  abstract = "Leading flood loss estimation models include Federal Emergency
              Management Agency's (FEMA's) Hazus, FEMA's Flood Assessment
              Structure Tool (FAST), and (U.S.) Hydrologic Engineering Center's
              Flood Impact Analysis (HEC-FIA), with each requiring different
              data input. No research to date has compared the resulting
              outcomes from such models at a neighborhood scale. This research
              examines the building and content loss estimates by Hazus Level
              2, FAST, and HEC-FIA, over a levee-protected census block in
              Metairie, in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Building attribute data
              in National Structure Inventory (NSI) 2.0 are compared against
              ``best available data'' (BAD) collected at the individual
              building scale from Google Street View, Jefferson Parish building
              inventory, and 2019 National Building Cost Manual, to assess the
              sensitivity of input building inventory selection. Results
              suggest that use of BAD likely enhances flood loss estimation
              accuracy over existing reliance on default data in the software
              or from a national data set that generalizes over a broad scale.
              Although the three models give similar mean (median) building and
              content loss, Hazus Level 2 results diverge from those produced
              by FAST and HEC-FIA at the individual building level. A
              statistically significant difference in mean (median) building
              loss exists, but no significant difference is found in mean
              (median) content loss, between building inventory input (i.e.,
              NSI 2.0 vs BAD), but both the building and content loss vary at
              the individual building scale due to difference in
              building-inventory-reported foundation height, foundation type,
              number of stories, replacement cost, and content cost. Moreover,
              building loss estimation also differs significantly by
              depth-damage function (DDF), for flood depths corresponding with
              the longest return periods, with content loss differing
              significantly by DDF at all return periods tested, from 10 to 500
              years. Knowledge of the extent of estimated differences aids in
              understanding the degree of uncertainty in flood loss estimation.
              Much like the real estate industry uses comparable home values to
              appraise a home, flood loss planners should use multiple models
              to estimate flood-related losses. Moreover, results from this
              study can be used as a baseline for assessing losses from other
              hazards, thereby enhancing protection of human life and property.",

              recently released building inventory for the United States, with
              a local tax assessor building inventory for use in damage and
              loss modeling of seismic-tsunami hazards. The city of Seaside,
              Oregon located in the North American Pacific Northwest and
              subject to seismic-tsunami hazards from the Cascadia Subduction
              Zone is used as a testbed. Input attributes -- such as spatial
              footprint, year built, structure type, and number of stories --
              are compared at the parcel, block, block group, and tract levels.
              The input attributes show large differences at the parcel level
              and compare favorably when aggregated at increased spatial
              scales. The National Structure Inventory consistently
              underestimates structure value and number of stories compared to
              the tax assessor data. Expected damages across 7 mean recurrence
              intervals, from 100-yr to 10,000-yr, are computed using IN-CORE,
              an open-source community resilience model. Expected damage to the
              National Structure Inventory tends to be slightly larger than
              that of the tax assessor data and errors are reduced when
              aggregated at increased spatial scales. The National Structure
              Inventory underpredicts total economic losses and risks compared
              to the tax assessor data, particularly for recurrence intervals
              associated with high economic risks. A variance-based sensitivity
              analysis is performed to identify how uncertainties in the input
              attributes propagate to uncertainties in expected damage.
              Structure type, design-level, and building location all influence
              expected damages for seismic-tsunami hazards, highlighting the
              importance of accurate building inventories in multi-hazard
              damage and loss modeling.",

               represent the most likely value from a distribution of possible
               values. The uncertainty in the point estimate ? the width of the
               range of possible values at a given level of confidence ? is a
               critical piece of the AVM output, especially in collateral and

               remains highly unstandardised in both terminology and methods.
               In this paper, we present and compare two of the most common
               approaches to estimating AVM uncertainty ? model-based and
               error-based prediction intervals. We also present a uniform
               language and framework for evaluating the calibration and
               efficiency of uncertainty estimates. Based on empirical tests on

               model-based approaches outperform error-based ones in all but
               cases with very highest confidence level requirements. The

               Incorporating recent developments in inundation modelling, here
               we show a 26.4\% (24.1--29.1\%) increase in US flood risk by
               2050 due to climate change alone under RCP4.5. Our national
               depiction of comprehensive and high-resolution flood risk
               estimates in the United States indicates current average annual
               losses of US$32.1 billion (US$30.5--33.8 billion) in 2020's

               communities with a proportionally larger White population. The

               could cause flood risk increases that outweigh the impact of
               climate change fourfold. These results make clear the need for
               adaptation to flood and emergent climate risks in the United
               States, with mitigation required to prevent the acceleration of
               these risks. Climate change is increasing flood risk, yet models
               based on historical data alone cannot capture the impact.
               Granular mapping of national flood risk shows that losses caused
               by flooding in the United States will increase substantially by
