# Uncertain Structure and Fragility Ensemble (UNSAFE)
This repository hosts the latest UNSAFE version. It also includes example code that demonstrates a workflow for using UNSAFE with flood inundation model outputs to estimate property-level flood risks.

## Statement of need
Flooding is a frequent, widespread, and damaging natural hazard in the United States. Economic flood risk estimates are increasingly used in research and practice to help inform management practices and policies. Economic flood risk is estimated as a function of hazard (i.e. the features of a flood over space and time), exposure (i.e. the assets that experience inundation from a flood), and vulnerability (i.e. the susceptibility of exposed assets to damage for a set of flood features).

It is common for property-level economic flood risk assessments to overlook uncertainty in all inputs. When uncertainty is incorporated into these assessments, it is more common to account for uncertainty in flood hazard than in exposure or vulnerability. While it is a common finding that flood risk estimates are most sensitive to uncertainty in flood hazard estimates, overlooking uncertainty in exposure and vulnerability can bias risk estimates.

The Uncertain Structure and Fragility Ensemble (UNSAFE) framework aims to fill the need for a published, free, and open-source tool for representing exposure and vulnerability under uncertainty for flood-risk estimation in the U.S. We invite others to contribute to this project to help standardize best practices in the estimation of flood risk under uncertainty, improve reusability and efficiency, expand functionality for more use-cases, and maintain a state-of-the-art risk estimation codebase that is free and usable by any interested party.
