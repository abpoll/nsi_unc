# Overview
This is the "full" data example. In addition to the notebook that holds the code for the intended UNSAFE workflow, `full_data_example.ipynb` we also have the `prepare_partial_example.ipynb` notebook where we clip the hazard data from the full data example and prepare the data for the `partial_data_example.ipynb` example.
